## Abstract

Dengue virus (DENV) exists as four genetically distinct serotypes, each of which is historically assumed to be antigenically uniform. However, recent analyses suggest that antigenic heterogeneity may exist within each serotype, but its source, extent and impact remain unclear. Here, we construct a sequence-based model to directly map antigenic change to underlying genetic divergence. We identify 49 specific substitutions and four colinear substitution clusters that robustly predict dengue antigenic relationships. We report moderate antigenic diversity within each serotype, resulting in variation in genotype-specific patterns of heterotypic cross-neutralization. We also quantify the impact of antigenic variation on real-world DENV population dynamics, and find that serotype-level antigenic fitness is a dominant driver of dengue clade turnover. These results provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between dengue genetic and antigenic evolution, and quantify the effect of antigenic fitness on dengue evolutionary dynamics.

## Install

Everything is Python 2.7 based. Python packages that are required can be installed via:

```
cd dengue-antigenic-dynamics/
pip install -r requirements
```

## Analysis outline

1. [Run the titer model via augur](titer_model/) (repackaged portion of the [Nextstrain](www.nextstrain.org/dengue) pipeline) to build a viral phylogeny, assign antigenic change to specific mutations, and infer clade frequencies.
2. [Run the fitness model](fitness_model/) to quantify population immunity over time, predict clade frequencies, and assess performance.
3. [Use the visualization notebooks](figures/) to explore results and recreate all the figures from the paper.
